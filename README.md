# Credit-EDA
This project aims to analyze the lending data of a bank to understand the risk of losing money while lending to customers. The data includes information on customer demographics, credit history, loan amount, loan term, and other relevant variables.

## Data Source
The data was obtained from the XYZ Bank, and it includes a sample of 30,000 loan applications.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA was performed to gain insights into the lending data and to understand the risk factors that could lead to loan defaults. The following are some of the key findings:

- The code gender for non-defaulters in Female is 66.6% and Male is 33.4%. 
- The code gender for defaulters in Female is 57.1% and Male is 42.9%.
- The car owning people contributes 65.7% to the non-defaulters and 69.5% to the defaulters.
- The married people contribute 64.2% to non defaulters and 59.8% to defaulters.
- The graph shows that 25-30 age group people are more in default list.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization was used to represent the findings from the EDA. The following are some of the visualizations used:

- Histograms and density plots to visualize the distribution of loan amount, loan term, and interest rate.
- Bar plots to visualize the purpose of the loans and the loan status.
- Heatmaps to visualize the correlation between different variables.

## Conclusion
The EDA revealed some interesting insights into the lending data of the bank. The analysis could be further extended to develop a risk model that can predict the probability of loan defaults based on the customer's demographic and credit history. This would help the bank minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
