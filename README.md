# Credit-EDA
Identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal of this analysis is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn and to provide recommendations to reduce churn rate.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information on customers who have left or are still with the company. The dataset includes variables such as customer demographics, services used, and account information.

Data Cleaning
Before beginning the analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure data quality. The following steps were taken:

Removed duplicates
Handled missing values
Removed irrelevant variables
Transformed variables as needed
Exploratory Data Analysis
The following questions were explored to understand customer churn:

What is the overall churn rate?
What are the demographics of customers who churn?
What services are customers who churn subscribed to?
How does tenure affect churn?
How does monthly charges affect churn?
The findings of the analysis are presented in a Jupyter Notebook (telco_customer_churn.ipynb). The notebook includes visualizations and descriptive statistics to help understand the relationships between variables.

Conclusion
The analysis found that customers who churn tend to have higher monthly charges and shorter tenure. The company can reduce churn rate by providing discounts to long-term customers or by reducing monthly charges for customers who have high charges. Additionally, the company can explore offering more personalized services to better retain customers.
