# Credit-EDA
This project aims to analyze the lending data of a bank to understand the risk of losing money while lending to customers. The data includes information on customer demographics, credit history, loan amount, loan term, and other relevant variables.

## Data Source
The data was obtained from the XYZ Bank, and it includes a sample of 10,000 loan applications.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.8
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA was performed to gain insights into the lending data and to understand the risk factors that could lead to loan defaults. The following are some of the key findings:

- The loan amount ranges from $1,000 to $50,000, with an average of $10,000.
- The loan term ranges from 12 to 60 months, with an average of 36 months.
- The interest rate ranges from 5.5% to 24.5%, with an average of 12.5%.
- The majority of the loans were issued for debt consolidation purposes (55%).
- The default rate is 15%, which indicates that the bank is at risk of losing money on 15% of its loans.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization was used to represent the findings from the EDA. The following are some of the visualizations used:

- Histograms and density plots to visualize the distribution of loan amount, loan term, and interest rate.
- Bar plots to visualize the purpose of the loans and the loan status.
- Heatmaps to visualize the correlation between different variables.

## Conclusion
The EDA revealed some interesting insights into the lending data of the bank. The default rate of 15% indicates that the bank is at risk of losing money on a significant portion of its loans. The analysis could be further extended to develop a risk model that can predict the probability of loan defaults based on the customer's demographic and credit history. This would help the bank minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
